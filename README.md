### Docker image

`$WAIT` specifies for how long the application should wait before running. This can bes jused in conjunction with `restart: always` to make the bridge run at regular intervals. If you don't desire any waiting effect you can simply set the entrypoint to `./goldapps`.

For some reason `entrypoint` has to be specified in the compose file or the docker run command.

The command should be your flags for the `goldapps` command

See `prod.docker-compose.yaml` as reference.

### Command `goldapps`

The following flags are available:
* `-y`: No interacting from the user required.
* `-i`: Ask the user about everything...
* `-dry`: Makes sure the program does not change anything.
* `-from someString`: Set the group source to `ldap`, `gapps` or `*.json`. In case of `gapps` config value `gapps.provider` will be used.
* `-to someString`: Set the group consumer to 'gapps' or '*.json'. In case of `gapps` config value `gapps.consumer` will be used.
* `-users`: Only collect and sync users
* `-groups`: Only collect and sync groups
* `-additions *.json`: file with additions


Notice that flags should be combined on the form `goldapps -a -b` and **NOT** on the form `goldapps -ab`.
