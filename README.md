Read setup first

### Docker image

`$WAIT` specifies for how long the application should wait before running. This can bes jused in conjunction with `restart: always` to make the bridge run at regular intervals. If you don't desire any waiting effect you can simply set the entrypoint to `./goldapps`.

For some reason `entrypoint` has to be specified in the compose file or the docker run command.

The command should be your flags for the `goldapps` command

### Command `goldapps`

The following flags are available:

- `-y`: No interacting from the user required.
- `-i`: Ask the user about everything...
- `-dry`: Makes sure the program does not change anything.
- `-from someString`: Set the group source to `ldap`, `gapps` or `*.json`. In case of `gapps` config value `gapps.provider` will be used.
- `-to someString`: Set the group consumer to 'gapps' or '\*.json'. In case of `gapps` config value `gapps.consumer` will be used.
- `-users`: Only collect and sync users
- `-groups`: Only collect and sync groups
- `-additions *.json`: file with additions

Notice that flags should be combined on the form `goldapps -a -b` and **NOT** on the form `goldapps -ab`.
